# Feedforward-Neural-Network-for-XOR-Logic-Function
This project builds a feedforward neural network (FFNN) in Python with NumPy and Matplotlib to solve the XOR problem. Using a 2-2-1 architecture with sigmoid activation, it demonstrates how hidden layers enable neural networks to handle non-linearly separable tasks.
